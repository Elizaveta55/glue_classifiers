Repository's stracture is the following:
- `GLUE classifiers.pdf` file with short report of applied experiments and classifiers performance.
- `CoLA_dataset.ipynb` notebook with python script for CoLA dataset. It does not reflect complete outputs of cells therefore it is recommentded to use Colab source for exploration outputs of notebook. The code is organized with different sells which can be launched one-by-one.
- `RTE_dataset.ipynb` notebook with python script for RTE dataset. It does not reflect complete outputs of cells therefore it is recommentded to use Colab source for exploration outputs of notebook. The code is organized with different sells which can be launched one-by-one.
- `SST_2_dataset.ipynb` notebook with python script for SST-2 dataset. It does not reflect complete outputs of cells therefore it is recommentded to use Colab source for exploration outputs of notebook. The code is organized with different sells which can be launched one-by-one.
